		# ScriptAlias: This controls which directories contain server scripts. 
		<br>
		# ScriptAliases are essentially the same as Aliases, except that <br>
		# documents in the realname directory are treated as applications and 
		<br>
		# run by the server when requested rather than as documents sent to the 
		client. <br>
		# The same rules about trailing &quot;/&quot; apply to ScriptAlias directives 
		as to <br>
		# Alias. <br>

		# AddType allows you to tweak mime.types without actually editing it, 
		or to <br>
		# make certain files to be certain types. <br>
		# <br>
		# For example, the PHP 3.x module (not part of the Apache distribution 
		- see <br>
		# http://www.php.net) will typically use: <br>
		# <br>
		#AddType application/x-httpd-php3 .php3 <br>
		#AddType application/x-httpd-php3-source .phps <br>
		# <br>
		# And for PHP 4.x, use: <br>
		# </p>
	  <p> AddType application/x-tar .tgz </p>
	  <p>AddType application/x-httpd-php .php <br>
		AddType application/x-httpd-php-source .phps </p>
	  <p># Action lets you define media types that will execute a script whenever 
		<br>
		# a matching file is called. This eliminates the need for repeated URL 
		<br>
		# pathnames for oft-used CGI file processors. <br>
		# Format: Action media/type /cgi-script/location <br>
		# Format: Action handler-name /cgi-script/location <br>
		# </p>
	  <p>Action application/x-httpd-php /php/ C:/php/php.exe </p>

	  <p> ISAP Apache 1.3 </p>
	  <p>If you would like to use PHP as a module in Apache, be sure to move php4ts.dll 
		to the windows/system (for Windows 9x/Me) or winnt/system32 (for Windows 
		NT/2000/XP) directory, overwriting any older file. Then you should add 
		the following two lines to you Apache conf file: </p>
	  <p> LoadModule php4_module c:/php/sapi/php4apache.dll </p>
	  <p>AddModule mod_php4.c</p>
	  <p>AddType application/x-httpd-php .php .phtml </p>
	  <p> After changing the configuration file, remember to restart the server, 
		for example, NET STOP APACHE followed by NET START APACHE, if you run 
		Apache as a Windows Service, or use your regular shortcuts. </p>
	  <p>Note: You may find after using the windows installer for Apache that 
		you need to define the AddModule directive for mod_php4.c in the configuration 
		file (httpd.conf). This is done by adding AddModule mod_php4.c to the 
		AddModule list, near the beginning of the configuration file. This is 
		especially important if the ClearModuleList directive is defined. Failure 
		to do this may mean PHP will not be registered as an Apache module. </p>
	  <p>There are 2 ways you can use the source code highlighting feature, however 
		their ability to work depends on your installation. If you have configured 
		Apache to use PHP as an ISAPI module, then by adding the following line 
		to your configuration file you can use this feature: AddType application/x-httpd-php-source 
		.phps </p>
